/**I used a simple for loop
 * The values are stored in c
 * The first part c = 1; is the value of c at the beginning
 * c <= 5 is the condition. AS long as c is smaller or equal to 5 the loop can happen again
 * c++ is the same as c = c + 1 meaning for each loop the added value to c is 1
 * The loop stops when c=5 
 * and then in {} i printed out what c is in ever loop.
 * so for every time c increases by one all the way up to 5, the value prints in the console
