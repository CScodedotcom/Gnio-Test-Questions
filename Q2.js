let name = "Claudia";   
// a variable that stores in a string e.g my name

let age = 18;           
// a variable that stores in a value e.g an age

age = age + 1;         
// since I have used let the variable can be changed later


console.log(`${name}`);     
// I can print it to the console

console.log(`Hi my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`)    
// I can even indent the variables in a sentence
